# Android-labs
This repository contains multiple Android Studio projects developed as part of laboratory exercises during my university studies.
## `Lab1&2`  
The goal of this exercise was to grasp the very basics of Android software development, such as:<br> • Android Studio and Android SDK;<br> • UI design;<br> • Multithreading in Kotlin.<br> • Android Intents.
## `Lab3`  
The goal of this exercise was to understand file access mechanisms in Android applications, including:  
• Direct file access via file paths (both private and shared storage);  
• Handling file permissions for accessing public directories;  
• Using the Storage Access Framework for indirect file access via URIs;   
• Implementing a simple text editor with file reading, editing, and saving capabilities.
