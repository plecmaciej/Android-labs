# Android-labs
This repository contains multiple Android Studio projects developed as part of laboratory exercises during my university studies.
## `Lab1&2`  
The goal of this exercise was to grasp the very basics of Android software development, such as:<br> • Android Studio and Android SDK;<br> • UI design;<br> • Multithreading in Kotlin.<br> • Android Intents.
## `Lab3`  
The goal of this exercise was to understand file access mechanisms in Android applications, including:  
• Direct file access via file paths (both private and shared storage);  
• Handling file permissions for accessing public directories;  
• Using the Storage Access Framework for indirect file access via URIs;   
• Implementing a simple text editor with file reading, editing, and saving capabilities.  
## `Lab4`  
The goal of this exercise was to understand and implement background operations in Android using Services, including:  
• Creating a custom Service to measure and track elapsed time;  
• Binding and unbinding activities to the service for two-way communication;  
• Implementing two communication strategies between the service and the activity (callback interface or direct polling);  
• Displaying regular updates of service data (elapsed time) in the activity;  
• Running the service as a foreground service with a persistent notification;  
• Handling runtime permissions for foreground services and notifications (especially on Android 13+).
